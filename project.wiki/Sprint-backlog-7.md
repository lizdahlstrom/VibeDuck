## Analysis of the previous iteration

Last iteration was spent refactoring the code, splitting it into smaller components, adding comments (JSDOCs), some tests and a couple of features. The user can now base the playlist from a mix of genres, artists and tracks. Implementing these features took longer than expected and I ended up having to fix bugs. Some time was spent on researching what elements the component should use to provide a good user experience.
