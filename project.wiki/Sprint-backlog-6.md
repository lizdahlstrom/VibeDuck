## Analysis of the previous iteration

I spent quite some time in the previous iteration on trying to add a reset settings button, during which time I discovered flaws in the code structure which made it more difficult to complete the task. I decided to drop the task before I refactor and implement tests on the components involved. Further UI bugs were solved. I added feedback to the user when adding a playlist to the library. As a result of a couple of compeleted moderated user tests, further small tweaks were added to make the user experience a little smoother, and more items were added to the product backlog in regards of user experience. Some research was done on how to create a good user experience, and furthermore on how to test the components using Jest and React Testing Library.
