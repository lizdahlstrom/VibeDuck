## Analysis of the previous iteration

After I somewhat early managed to solve the problem with the firebase functions since the iteration before, I could spend the last iteration putting together front end components. During the iteration I took use of the context hook, which solved most problems I had with passing data. The user can now log in, add songs to base the playlist from, then generate a playlist, select a length and save it to their library. The UI is a bit quirky and does not offer much of style so far, since I have tried and focused as much as possible on functionality in the previous iteration.
