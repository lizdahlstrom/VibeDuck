## Analysis of the previous iteration

Last components needed for a complete functional application were added, and so all requirements from the product backlog with priority 1-2 have been completed. A couple of user tests were made and a couple of bugs found and fixed. A lot of time was spent refactoring the code and fixing problems with the layout and components, which left less time to write tests. Some testing tasks will be handled this week instead.
