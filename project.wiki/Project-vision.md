## Background and problem description

Spotify is a music streaming application that is popular around the world. A main feature of the application is the ability to create, save and share playlists. One typical way of composing a playlist is manually searching Spotify for songs, either directly or through artist pages, or even through browsing through already existing playlists and then adding these songs to a new playlist. This can become a quite tedious process depending of what type of playlist the user is composing and how picky they are. For example, if the user is putting together a themed playlist it is unavoidable that multiple steps might have to be taken repeatedly in order to find songs that fit the theme.  
The idea of my application is to offer an alternate way of creating new playlists. With the use of some user input the application will not only automatically generate playlists with a mix of songs that fit the user criteria, but also present and opportunity for the user to discover music without having to browse Spotify manually.

## Target User Groups

The main target user group of the application is Spotify users who enjoy composing playlists with different themes or want to discover songs and artists that fit their taste.

## Competing and Similar Systems

There are already existing ways to generate playlists within Spotify itself. As an example Spotify offers an option to create a playlist based on an existing one. There are even auto-generated lists that get updated and are personal to each user such as "Release radar", "Discover weekly" or a series of "Made for you" lists. Furthermore there are several third party web applications that allows the user to type in one or more artists, and based on that data a list gets generated than can easily be saved to the user library.

## Unique Selling Points

By using the application the user will be able to generate playlists after his or her own specific taste and requirements, and is not tied to previous listening history. The application is aimed to have a selection of parameters to choose from and adjust when generating playlists, which will give the user better control than using any of the popular existing options. An intuitive and clean interface will make the user experience pleasurable rather than frustrating, and the user will not be forced to tweak the parameters but instead be rather encouraged. Another quite unique feature is that the application will offer a way to save the users favorite settings, so that the user can come back to the application in the future and reuse them when generating new playlists. By presenting the generated playlists to the user with the ability to preview the songs, the user can easily decide whether or not to save it to their library and/or to further explore the settings.

## Technology

- Front-end: React (JavaScript)
- Back-end: Firebase
- Spotify API

As front-end technology I will be using React since I have an interest in learning how to work with it, mainly because it is popular in the field and might be considered a merit in my future career. I do not have previous experience in working with React except for briefly trying it out. I do however have some experience in using Firebase since before and I know that it is easy to use and access, which is why I chose it for back-end. The application will be built relying on the Spotify API.
